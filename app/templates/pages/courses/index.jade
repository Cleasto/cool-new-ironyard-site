              | <em>We believe syntax is the easy part of programming and that we are successful when we’ve helped someone learn to think like an engineer.</em>

              | <strong>Real projects over scripted assignments</strong><br>
              | <em>People learn programming best by tackling hard problems with a mentor, not following a list of steps and taking a quiz.</em>

              | <em>Our teachers stay sharp by taking time off in between classes to freelance, build products and run companies, ensuring the latest, greatest curriculum every semester.</em>

          | At each of our locations we offer free code classes for kids. We believe in investing in the local tech economy for the long-run, and that means impacting the next generation.<br><br>
          | Students in our intensive courses are required to volunteer, teach and run our Kids programs as a part of their involvement in the Academy.
