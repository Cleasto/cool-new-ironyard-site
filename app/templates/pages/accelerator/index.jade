    h3 What makes us different, you ask?
    
    p It's a secret sauce with three ingredients.
    p <strong> The first is our network of mentors.</strong> CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.
    p <strong> The second is The Iron Yard Alumni network.</strong>  Our portfolio of 49 companies have raised more than $40,000,000 in follow-on funding. While many of our companies remain in the Greenville area, these companies are headquartered around the country - from the Carolinas to California, Texas to Washington, DC and many places in between.  Did we mention that we also run the largest code school in the country that helps provide a pipeline of technical team members as you grow?
    p <strong> The third is The Iron Yard community.</strong> Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events.
