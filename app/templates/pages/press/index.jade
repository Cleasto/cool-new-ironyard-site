        h3 About The Iron Yard
        p The Iron Yard is the largest code school in the country. We teach intensive, three-month courses that mentor our students into professional junior-level programmers. Our classes goes far beyond tactical skill and teach people to think like software engineers. Programming is a lifelong study, and our process shows students how to learn on their own they remain highly valuable throughout their careers. We also help each graduate find work after the program through our career support program and ongoing education tracks.
