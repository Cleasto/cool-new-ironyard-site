        p(style="padding-right: 10px;") At The Iron Yard we have created an environment that is exciting, intellectually challenging, and culturally diverse. We work hard, smart, and collaboratively because <a href="#mission">our mission</a> is worthy of our time and investment. We attract talented, capable, and hungry people who are resourceful, creative, and trustworthy. Then, we ask them to do great, life-changing work in the service of others. Does this resonate with you? We'd love to chat.

          | The world has huge problems that need to be solved, many of which technology is perfectly suited to address. Companies full of designers and developers around the globe are answering this call, but there’s a problem: there aren’t enough of them. While data shows a current surplus of American graduates with STEM degrees, anyone on the ground in the tech industry has felt the acute shortage of high-quality developers. What’s more, over the next 10 years there will be <em>1.4 million jobs in computer science but only 400,000 qualified graduates</em>.<br><br>
          | The Iron Yard is a solution at that juncture of supply, demand, and a broken education system. We are committed to training the highest-quality developers in the world, both in skill and in character. Our mission is to find people who want to pursue the <em>craft</em> and <em>life-long adventure</em> of programming, teach them the tools of the trade, teach them how to teach themselves, and then release them into the world with the drive and capability to make a difference. We believe that passionate, talented people who love what they do will create great families, jobs, companies, and solutions to the world’s problems.<br><br>
          | We want to accomplish this alongside talented, passionate people who share our vision, love what they do, and want to have a whole lot of fun along the way.

          | If you walk into The Iron Yard on any given afternoon, you’re as likely to see an engineering team architecting software as you are to see a group enjoying craft brews over ping pong and video games.<br><br>
          | We’ve been told we’re a “work hard, play hard” crew, and we couldn’t agree more. Our standards for producing awesome stuff are extremely high, but so is our capacity to truly enjoy life alongside the people we work with.<br><br>
          | Here are a few characteristics of how we work:
        ul
          li <em>People first, always</em> – We absolutely love what we get to do everyday, but more importantly we’re passionate about who we get to do it with and the entrepreneurs and students we get to serve—they’re the reason we come to work.
          li <em>Flat structure and highly entrepreneurial</em> – We don’t manage people, we give them a goal and let them use their skills to accomplish it in the best way possible. This can be difficult if you like a lot of structure and daily direction. For the self-starter types, though, it’s vocational bliss.
          li <em>Open mindset</em> – The Iron Yard is an open place for people of all kinds; we don’t believe in molds, stereotypes, or any sort of discrimination. Also, we don’t believe in artificial scarcity—if we can help someone, we will. If a project can have a bigger impact being open-sourced, we’ll open source it.
          li <em>‘Being home for dinner’ policy</em> – We work really hard, but a constantly imbalanced life isn’t healthy for anyone. We work fast, efficient, and fun so that we can invest in important areas of life outside the office
