He started his career in professional sports working for the NBA before discovering his love for tech. Kyle comes to the Iron Yard because of his deeply held belief in the power of education but poor experience with the current education system; he believes there is a better way. Couple that with the real world experience where he couldn't find quality developers and you have a perfect match. In addition to being an Iron Man enthusiast, he loves new experiences, a finely crafted cup of coffee, and a great view. He tries as hard as he can to enjoy all of the things he just mentioned, his beautiful wife, and baby girl.",

After college, she was on the road to pursuing a career in Acting/Directing when she got pregnant. When no one would cast her in all her pregnant glory, she decided to start doing stand-up comedy. At the very least, people would laugh at how weird she looked. After doing stand-up for a couple of years, she had her second daughter and decided that the life of a traveling comedian was not what she wanted as a mother. She decided to make a life change, which included attending The Iron Yard, herself! She graduated from the Front End Engineering program in Atlanta in August 2014. She loved TIY so much, she decided she wanted to work there. Luckily, the feeling was mutual, and here she is!",

I’ve built projects ranging from shipping terminal management systems to MMORPG registration sites and everything in between. Over time, I’ve transitioned from building mostly native applications to building almost everything using standard web technology. Along the way, I’ve taught and mentored others — something that I’ve always found to be deeply rewarding. So what do you get when you combine love/knowledge of tech with love of teaching? The IronYard! That’s why I’m thrilled to be joining as a front end instructor. When I’m not busy hacking code, I may be found playing soccer, ultimate, or foos. Or maybe tinkering around on my guitar. Or hiking somewhere with my beautiful wife. Or painting. Or reading a good book. Or reading a bad book. Or writing sentence fragments.(photo taken from my wedding - it’s the only time our students will see me in a suit) ",

He is just as excited to leave behind the long-wintered north as he is to be a part of The Iron Yard. As a developer he has had a wide range of experiences from roles in small startups to large, publicly traded companies. He is also the co-founder of an agency that has worked alongside Fortune 500 companies. When not programming, he can be found playing music or catching up on one of the many documentaries found on Netflix",

(born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.",
