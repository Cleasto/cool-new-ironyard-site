        p 
          | Over the course of three months, a practicing iOS nerd (and skilled instructor) will teach you the ins-and-outs of iOS app development using Xcode 5 and a whole lot of Objective-C. At the end of the class you’ll have the skills to create beautiful, fully functional iOS apps and the foundation to pursue building Mac apps as well.<br><br>
          | The best part: we’ll help you get a job offer as a mobile developer when you graduate (or your tuition back, guaranteed). Don’t know any code? Don’t worry. Our proven teachers and process will take you from zero to hero and mentor you into a professional junior-level programmer.

          p(style="max-width:960px; margin:0 auto;") Our intensive Mobile Engineering courses run for 12 weeks. The schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend’s homework.

        h3: em Lecture Time
        p Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive and fun. All of our instructors use a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.

        h3: em Lab Time
        p You’ll have homework every single day…and it ain’t easy. All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn’t keep you busy enough, we start sending you real, paid freelance work. You’ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil.

          | <strong>Being a programmer is more than just writing code.</strong><br> 
          | We put serious focus on the qualitative aspects of work, from team projects to mock job interviews. We also partner with guest speakers who cover a variety of topics like design and freelancing, and we take class field trips to real businesses like MailChimp and BMW. Employers have told us our grads are some of the most well-rounded, teachable hires they’ve ever made.

          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing Objective-C doesn’t make you’re great at building apps; that’s the easy part of mobile development. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you think like an engineer. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level mobile devs. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, learning everything below and then some. Some topics like Core Libraries will take weeks to cover, and others like Objects and Classes will be taught in just a few lectures.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.
