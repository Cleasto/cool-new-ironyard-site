          | Over the course of three months, a practicing veteran (and skilled teacher) will show you the ins-and-outs of Front End Engineering using HTML, CSS, a whole lot of JavaScript and some basic server-side tech. At the end of the class you’ll have the skills to create beautiful, fully functional websites and web applications.<br><br>
          | The best part: we’ll help you get a job offer as a mobile developer when you graduate (or your tuition back, <em>guaranteed</em>). Don’t know any code? Don’t worry. Our proven teachers and process will take you from zero to hero and mentor you into a professional junior-level programmer.

The schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend’s homework.

        h3: em Lecture Time
        p Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive and fun. All of our instructors use a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.

        h3: em Lab Time
        p You’ll have homework every single day…and it ain’t easy. All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn’t keep you busy enough, we start sending you <em>real, paid freelance work</em>. You’ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil.

          | <strong>Being a programmer is more than just writing code.</strong><br> 
          | We put serious focus on the qualitative aspects of work, from team projects to mock job interviews. We also partner with guest speakers who cover a variety of topics like design and freelancing, and we take class field trips to real businesses like MailChimp and BMW. Employers have told us our grads are some of the most well-rounded, teachable hires they’ve ever made.

          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing JavaScript doesn’t make you’re great at building apps; that’s the easy part of front end development. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you <em>think like an engineer</em>. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level programmers. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, learning everything below and then some. Some topics like Backbone.js will take weeks to cover, others like JavaScript templates will be taught in just a few lectures.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.

            | <strong>Git and GitHub</strong><br>
            | Master Git for personal and team workflows. All of your code will live on GitHub from day one.<br><br>
            | <strong>HTML and CSS</strong><br>
            | We’ll go from HTML foundations to HTML5 APIs. In CSS, we cover layouts, typography and CSS3 animations. We’ll also utilize preprocessors like SASS/Compass, Styles, Slim, Jade and Stylus.<br><br>
            | <strong>Building Responsive Sites</strong><br>
            | We teach media queries and responsive design early and require almost every layout to be fully functional across all screen sizes.<br><br>
            | <strong>Design fundamentals</strong><br>
            | Every student learns strong fundamentals in layout, typography, color theory, user interface and user experience.<br><br>
            | <strong>Freelance fundamentals</strong><br>
            | Seasoned pros show you how to find good work, write contracts, set expectations, price well and communicate like a pro.<br><br>
            | <strong>JavaScript</strong><br>
            | We dive deep into JS, covering types, functions, objects, scope, closures, constructors, prototypes and much more.<br><br>
            | <strong>jQuery</strong><br>
            | You’ll learn everything from DOM manipulation to non-DOM methods ($.extend, $.proxy, etc) to Chaining, Callbacks and Promises.<br><br>
            | <strong>Underscore.js</strong><br>
            | Our grads are well versed in functional programming paradigm Underscore.js unlocks.

            | <strong>Backbone, Angular, and Ember</strong><br>

            | <strong>JavaScript Testing</strong><br>
            | Our students unit test every JS assignment with tools like Jasmine, Mocha and QUnit, and use continuous integration tools like Wercker and TravisCI.<br><br>
            | <strong>Languages that compile to JavaScript</strong><br>
            | We cover CoffeeScript and ClojureScript and a number of other popular languages.<br><br>
            | <strong>JavaScript Templating</strong><br>
            | Our students learn Underscore, Skim, and Jade and the importance of using JS templates for serious browser applications.<br><br>
            | <strong>Node.js Basics</strong><br>
            | We cover Heroku, Nodejitsu and other deployment tools.<br><br>
            | <strong>Deployment</strong><br>
            | We’ll teach you how to distribute your app for testing (each project will be deployed), and we’ll also show you how to get your app submitted—our goal is for you to leave class with an app live in the App Store.<br><br>
            | <strong>Parse as a Backend</strong><br>
            | With a tool like Parse, our front end students can do a massive amount of backend/database work on their web apps.<br><br>
            | <strong>Front End Tools</strong><br>
            | Yeoman, Grunt and Bower are just a few of the components you’ll use everyday.<br><br>
            | <strong>Getting Hired</strong><br>
            | We do mock interviews, resume writing and portfolio building. Grads have weekly meetings with our team to help find exciting jobs and projects.

          | Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be very challenging. The material gets really hard, really fast. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you’re going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn’t the place for you. (The average student puts in about 60 hours per week, minimum). We don’t require you to know code to start with, but you need to have tried it and enjoyed it. If that’s you, go ahead and <a href="#class-schedule">apply now</a>. If not, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">try a few exercises to see.</a><br><br>
          | We’re family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find joy in a great job, freelance work, or starting your own company when you’re done. We’re proud of all of the different types of people who have come through The Iron Yard, and we don’t have stereotypes of what a programmer is like. We’ve taught students from 18 to 50 years old, from different countries and all sorts of backgrounds.
        h3: em How Much Does It Cost?
        p <strong>Base tuition is $10,000</strong>, and we have significant discounts for enlisted military personnel and veterans, and not to mention a <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/scholarships">Women in Tech Scholarship</a>.

          | Like we said above, this won’t be a walk in the park. Prepare for a rigorous course.<br><br>
          | <strong>Self Motivated</strong><br>
          | If you need to be micro-managed, this isn’t the place for you.<br><br>
          | <strong>Works Well With Others</strong><br>
          | You’ll be assigned to groups for projects, and each person’s role will be crucial.<br><br>
          | <strong>Interested in Learning</strong><br>
          | Even if you know basics (or more), you might have to unlearn some things. We’ll start from the ground up as a team, and there won’t be room for egos.<br><br>
          | <strong>Graceful Problem Solver</strong><br>
          | We’ll work on some hard, frustrating stuff. Patience and endurance are necessities.<br><br>
          | <strong>Ready to Have Fun</strong><br>
          | We work hard, play hard, and laugh every single day. We do the best work we possibly can, but we make sure not to take ourselves too seriously.
